HTML5 Builder

Intro
  What is it? 
    PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, originally Personal Home Page)
      Free and open-source server side scripting language originally
      conceived to generate dynamic content on web sites.
      
    javascript
    html
    css
    RPCL :: RadPhp Component Library
  Mobile simulator
  Internal PHP "engine"

  What's new since the last version
    New IDE shows much less "clutter"
    CSS3 support
    Target ios, android, RIM devs, and general web
    HTML5 
            
  History
    Delphi for PHP -> Delphi for PHP 2 -> RadPHP XE -> RadPHP XE2 -> HTML5 Builder

  Competition
    Plug-in for VS 2010 (lacks drag 'n drop designer) Free. Open no
    Eclipse PHP Development Tools (IBM and Zend mostly, tough to use) Free. Open ?? 
    Zend studio. $300, closed source, Eclipse-based
    PhpStorm. 
    PhpED. By NuSphere
    phpDesigner
    Netbeans
    Komodo
    Aptana. Eclipse based
    Sublime Text 2
    
    

Demo Apps
  Trivial "Server" (5 mins ... user input + output eval())
  Trivial "Client" (3 mins ... )
  Collect Form Information (may mash this into Google Map --> display example)
  Read from / Post to a DB
  2-D Canvas draw demo using Javascript (may do this with embarcadero sample proj)
  Show a TeeChart graph or do a Google Map coding example

Deploy
  Files to go
  example of mobile target (to simulator) of one project above

Ugly bug in HTML5 Builder IDE
  Quick fix
  Stability

Criticisms
  Slow startup
  No longer uses the same IDE as the rest of Rad Studio
  Ugly color scheme (supposedly themed but only dark theme exists)
  Poor defaults for object inspector colors and code window colors
  Comparing code in different files nearly impossible
  Switching between files is very mousy (eg cumbersome and slow)
  Too much mouse involvement, if keyboard can be used, well hidden
  I dislike seeing the Embarcadero news in my IDEs
